Data Pre- Processing and Model Building :

  Perform Logistic Regression as Classification Problems (0, 1):
           - Convert categorical columns into factors
           - Missing Value Treatment 
           - various Test - Histo, Boxplot, Barplot
           - Correlation Test - Anova, Chi-square test
           - Model Building 
           - compare with Decision Tree accuracy
